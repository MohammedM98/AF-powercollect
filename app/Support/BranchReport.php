 * was charged, paid, discounted and cleared, what was cancelled, and what
 * they owe at the end — which always adds up, since it is the same lines
 * summed both ways. Also where the payments came in (cash drawer, bank,
 * currency, collector), the readings entered.
 *
 * A line counts under its own type on the business day it was recorded,
 * unless it was cancelled before that day ended: then it, like every
 * reversal, counts as a correction on its own day. So a period is always
 * the sum of its days, and a past day's figures never change when a line
 * is cancelled later — the cancellation shows on the day it was made.
 * Amounts are worked out in cents.
